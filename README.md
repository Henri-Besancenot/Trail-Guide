# Trail-Guide

Project for the CS-E4400 - Design of WWW Services D course at Aalto University.

## Project Overview

Trail-Guide is a web application designed to help users discover hiking trails. The site will provide comprehensive information about various trails, including:

- Distance
- Estimated duration
- Difficulty level
- Points of interest

Users can browse and edit trails, filter them by different criteria, and view detailed descriptions, photos, and maps.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS, and a modern JavaScript/TypeScript framework (React.js or Vue.js)
- **Backend:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Nodes.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Design & Prototyping:** Figma or Canva
- **Maps & Visualization:** Google Maps API with GPX track display

To populate the database, we may extract publicly available trail data, focusing on routes relevant to our chosen region.

## Focus Area

Our primary focus is on the User Interface (UI). Since clear presentation of maps and trail data is essential, we aim to design a clean, intuitive interface with effective filters and user-friendly map integration. The UI will be evaluated and improved through iterative methods such as Cognitive Walkthroughs and Think-Aloud protocols.
